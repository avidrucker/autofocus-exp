Update `[Thursday, July 2nd, 2020]`: Thank you all for participating in this app construction project, data experiment, and quest for knowledge. This project is now officially closed`*`, though the results (and efforts and energy put in) will live on in a new form: "functional programming style AutoFocus" (abbrev. "FP-AF"). As part of this process, I will be [updating the user stores here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZUg1y6-fdnvYPiLu9joaE-Vifqe4W_dTsBdKYAAIdb8/edit?usp=sharing) as well as [updating and maintaining the new code here](https://github.com/avidrucker/fp-autofocus). Feel free to leave an issue on either repo or to email me directly if you have any questions.

Ps. I've left the readme as-is for historical purposes.

`*`We won't be taking on new participants, though still feel free to ask us how we're doing.
